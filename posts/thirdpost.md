After reading [Tales From the Teenage Cancel Culture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVrTF7Y3VLQ_J4OD2iqSPgrWlmnEbs7ljEZ5hkD8nvo/edit) I feel that the humankind has become very sensitive. I think that "Cancel Culture" is comical. I feel like not talking to somebody and blocking them on social media is extremely frivolous. If the problem were serious it would be easier just to confront them or report them directly to adults. Canceling someone is not only ineffective but also naive. From my experience, people throw around the word "cancel" around very often. It is often used as a joke and is always shrugged off. My friends often throw it around sarcastically. Reading these stories from the article has made me rethink the meaning of "canceling" sombody. People online like to throw the term cancel to anything politically incorrect or something extremely vague or subjective. It isn't a very accurate term anymore.

I personally have never been canceled or canceled somebody. I have witnessed it online on social media platforms like Twitter or YouTube. But most of the time it is shrugged off after a week. It is forgotten very quickly and sometimes benefited the "victim". It allows people to gain a lot of attention, negative or positive. Many of the cases wouldn't happen outside of the U.S.A. because of the different political views on races or genders. Canceling somebody for their thoughts and opinions for something that is heavily debated and depend on politics is very foolish. My opinion on this matter is extremely against the majority of people.
