Critical thinkers have traits that set them apart from normal people. According to a HackSpirit article, there are 16 characteristics that define a critical thinker.

After reading the article, I contemplated whether I was a critical thinker or not. I compared myself to the perfect critical thinker defined by the article and I found out I was somewhat similar to it. The traits of a critical thinker that I have are being objective, not passively accepting things, being sensitive to details, the ability to connect dots, open-minded, thinking outside the box, being introspective, having personal opinions, and the ability to make decisions. These are all things I would say describe me. But that doesn’t make me the perfect critical thinker. There are still traits that I don’t have that are crucial to critical thinking.

One problem I have is not begin able to change my mind about a certain topic. Once I have an opinion, my thoughts become blurred and I am locked into a view and unaware of it. If I am able to change this habit of mine, I think this would benefit my social skills and schoolwork tremendously.

Another trait I don’t have that is very necessary for critical thinking is asking questions. At school, I am a shy kid, I don’t like speaking up unless I have to. When I do have a question I tend to immediately try to solve it myself, “What is the obvious answer?” I ask myself or “I’ll figure it out later.” I think. My inability to ask questions makes me struggle a lot in some assignments because I wasn’t able to hear everything. If I start asking questions I would make classes a lot easier on myself and think more critically.
