English II Advanced this year was, seriously challenging. I mean, I knew it wasn't going to be a walk in the park, but the way we had to dig deep into those readings to find stuff to write about was intense. I've always been more STEM but this was completely different. It wasn't just about reading the stories and understanding what was going on; we had to uncover hidden meanings, themes, and connections. Honestly, I never knew there could be so many layers to a single piece of writing!

I absolutely loved diving into nonfiction! The research aspect was super interesting, and I felt like a total professional while digging up facts and info to support my arguments. It was really satisfying to see both points of views for each argument.

But, poetry? That was a whole different ball game. I just couldn't wrap my head around it. It felt like trying to decipher an alien language, and I never knew if I was on the right track or completely off. I mean, I appreciate the beauty and emotions behind the words, but sometimes it just felt like trying to catch smoke with my bare hands. It was frustrating, to say the least.

English II Advanced really put my essay-writing skills to the test this year! You'd think that after writing so many essays in my life, it would be a piece of cake, right? But nope, this class was a whole new level of challenging. The hidden meanings in the texts we had to analyze were like sneaky little ninjas, always hiding in plain sight. I had to read and re-read passages, trying to figure out what the author was really trying to say, which was both fun and frustrating. It was like solving a mystery, but the clues were buried in metaphors, symbolism, and allusions.

Even though English II Advanced was quite the challenge, I've been thinking about it, and I really believe this way of teaching is perfect. Yes, it was hard, and there were times when I felt like pulling my hair out, but it pushed me to grow and develop my skills in ways I never thought possible. The whole process of digging deep into readings, searching for hidden meanings, and being challenged to write well-thought-out essays â€“ it's all part of what makes this class so valuable. It's not just about memorizing facts or acing multiple-choice tests; it's about truly understanding the material and learning to think critically. I think that's what made the class so engaging and rewarding. Our teacher didn't spoon-feed us the answers; instead, they encouraged us to explore, ask questions, and discover things on our own. And that's an approach I can totally get behind!
