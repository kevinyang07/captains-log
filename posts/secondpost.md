Students have often always thought that talent and genetics determine their success. They think that their success will have an upper limit. In Angela Lee Duckworth's presentation about grit she explains why grit is the most important factor. Grit is the passion and perservance to pursue long term goals. She also explains that learning ability can change with effort and are not fixed and permenant. Her talk was very inspiring and motivational. I felt that I could improve myself in anything if I put the effort into it. I think for the most part this has been true in my school. I think that teachers have been teaching students the growth mindset very well and encourage even the "dumbest" students. I think most successful students are the grittier students rather than the talented ones.

From this presentation I learned that my learning ability is not fixed. Not only is it not fixed but can be improved drastically with hard work and determination. I learned that knowledge nor talent is the determining factor in success but rather hard work. I think this presentation is applicable to everybody not just students and children but to adults too. I would consider myself very talented at math but I could better myself at not only math but also other subjects too. To improve myself I would stop being distracted by games and computers and start a more strict routine and set goals too. My goals would motivate me to keep this routine and improve my overall self. Her speech is one of the best motivational presentations I have ever watched.
