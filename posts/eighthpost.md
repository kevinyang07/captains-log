It has been 4 months since school started and almost halfway through the school year. English has been a hard class. It has its ups and downs. Here are my thoughts and suggestions on improving the class. 

I think that the first semester was okay. It could have been better. It was partially due to my procrastination and also some on the class. I really enjoy the blogs because I was able to make my own styled blog instead of using the wordpress one. It allowed me to bring out my creativity with my coding skills. I think that the blog is a very good part of the class. 

One thing that we should do more in the class is the teacher going around and helping all the students. It really helps when the teacher talks to a table one on one and explains the big parts of the analysis. When the teacher talks to me about the prompt it really helps me think about the big parts. I think that increasing the frequency of this would really help my writing skills and analysis. 

One thing I think we did a little too often was focusing on the book too much. We used the coming of age novel way too many times and this became boring to analyze. The constant use of the coming of age novel makes the book boring and bland. 

Overall the class is great and I do enjoy reading new books and analyzing them for deeper meaning. The things mentioned aboves are just ways of making the class slightly better.
