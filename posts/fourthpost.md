I was recently looking through my music playlist and I noticed that my music followed a certain theme. Here I will show you my 6 favorite songs and how they relate to my life and why I enjoy them. First thing I notice is many of the songs I listen to don't have lyrics. For example, I enjoy listening to classical pieces like: 

Beethoven's famouse Moonlight Sonata

This song has highs and lows. It contains every part a song requires. I love this piece because of how relaxing it is to listen too.

Liszt's La Campanella

This piece is just impressive. Liszt really shows how beautiful a single piano can sound on its own. It really brings out the amazing aspect of the piano.

Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Winter being the most notable
~[](/img/fourseasons.mp3)
This song has not one impressive piece, not two, not three, but four parts that are all equally impressive and sound amazing. The four parts each represent a season and each song just represents the season so perfectly with the tone of the piece.

Blue Danube by Strauss

This piece makes me feel like I'm in another world. Listening to this piece is just relaxing. This is just a masterpiece!

I enjoy music without lyrics and have instrumental sounds rather than electronic sounds. As you can see I really enjoy classical pieces. These are just a few pieces I listen to while I study and relax. It allows my mind to focus really well. 

A few other pieces I really enjoy are

Chopin's Clarinet Quintet

This one shows off how it doesn't have to be just the piano but clarinets can do it too. The pieces is inspiring and soothing. I love the wistful feeling you get fron the clarinet and the dark parts of the clarinet at times.

Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor

This piece is just fantastic. It is thrilling to listen too. It really invokes strong emotions when you listen to these songs. They genuinely make my heart race. I love listening to this piece because there is so much expression and passion in the piano piece.
