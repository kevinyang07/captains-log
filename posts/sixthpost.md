Recently, I came across the website DIYMFA. They had a section called the writer igniter. The idea of this program is to give writers an idea for a short story. I was given the prompt with the main character is a celebrity's personal assistant who is trapped. The prop of the story is a dark secret and the setting is a fancy house.

Here is my attempt at this:

John is the personal assistant of celebrity, Elon Musk. Elon Musk is famous for cofounding PayPal and SpaceX. John has worked for Elon for over 20 years ever since he Elon started his entrepreneur career. Elon Musk, in his recent court case, was forced to buy Twitter. Elon Musk and John are good friends but John still works under him. John knew, from talking with him, that Elon didn't really want to buy Twitter. Elon would often joke about things on talk shows and podcasts but was always taken seriously buy the audience and host. Elon is a funny guy, or at least John thinks so. Elon walks into the Twitter headquarters with a sink and fired top executives. After Elon comes home from Twitter HQ, John prepares his dinner while Elon talks about his day. "Let that sink in!" Elon recalls. John laughs along while watching the water start to boil. Elon checks his phone noticing an important notification. Elon hurriedly yells, while walking away "I got something to do, I'll be back later".

John, while waiting, roams the entire house like he often does making sure everything is ok. He walks into the living room and notices that there is a little bump in the carpet. He lifts it up cautiously and finds a recently used trapdoor. John runs to the kitchen to grab a flashlight and walks down the creaky ladder. John looks around and realized there has been a vast basement underneath the house. He walked around and discovered lots of new inventions and crude prototypes. He noticed that many of the things were modifications of basic appliances. John realized that the ladder was no longer there and the ceiling was too hard to get to. John realizes that he has to get out before Elon gets home starts panicking and looking for things on the desks. John in a panic runs around the basement looking for anything that could aid him in his escape. Elon had just needed to check on something back at the Twitter HQ and came back quickly. He came home not noticing anything and sees the finished dinner. Elon sits down and enjoys his dinner, ignoring that John isn't there to serve him. John finally finds a ladder and jumps out back into the living room. John quietly runs to the restroom pretends to flush the toilet and come downstairs to greet Elon. John now knows about Elon's ambitious plans to innovate in the tech industry once again and tries his best to contain his excitement for what is to come.
